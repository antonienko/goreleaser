GoReleaser supports building and pushing artifacts into Sonatype Nexus repositories of type `raw`.

## How it works

You can declare multiple Nexus instances.
All binaries generated by your `builds` section will be pushed to
each configured Nexus.

If you have only one Nexus instance,
the configuration is as easy as adding to your `.goreleaser.yml` file 
the `URL` of your Nexus instance, the `name` of the repository,
the `directory` where you want to upload inside that repository
and your credentials (`username` and `password`):

```yaml
nexus_raws:
  -
    url: https://<Your-Instance>:<Your-Port>
    repository: example-repo
    directory: example-folder
    username: your-username
    password: your-password
```

Prerequisites:

- A running Nexus instance
- A user + password with grants to upload to that specific repository
